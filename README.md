# Pokedex

I used vite and react to create this simple application, i created 3 components with some properties.
There are 8 default pokemons and the app will select 4 random for each card. Then compare their combined experiences and announce the winning hand. Keep refreshing the page to get new random cards.
I have developed the app on github so you can check it out.

## Demo

The app is live at:
